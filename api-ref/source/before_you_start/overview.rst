Overview
========

Welcome to *Cloud Eye API Reference*. Cloud Eye is a multi-dimensional resource monitoring platform. Customers can use Cloud Eye to monitor the utilization of service resources, track the running status of cloud services, configure alarm rules and notifications, and quickly respond to resource changes.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on metrics, alarm rules, and monitoring data, such as querying the metric list and the alarm rule list, creating alarm rules, and deleting alarm rules. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0171212514>`.

If you plan to access Cloud Eye through an API, ensure that you are familiar with Cloud Eye concepts. For details, see "What Is Cloud Eye?" in the *Cloud Eye User Guide*.
